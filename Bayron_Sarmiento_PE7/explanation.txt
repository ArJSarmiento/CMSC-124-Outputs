Inheritance: The Dog and Cat classes extend the Animal class, inheriting its attributes and methods 
Method Overloading: The speak method is overloaded in the Dog and Cat classes, meaning they have different implementations of the same method 
Method Overriding: The makeSound method is overridden in the Dog and Cat classes, meaning they provide a new implementation of the same method from the Animal class
