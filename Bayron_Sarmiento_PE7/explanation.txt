This program demonstrates the following OOP concepts:

Encapsulation: The Shape, Circle, and Rectangle classes encapsulate their properties and provide getters and setters for accessing and modifying their properties (geeksforgeeks.org).
Inheritance: The Circle and Rectangle classes inherit from the Shape class, using the extends keyword (geeksforgeeks.org).
Method Overloading: The Shape class provides two overloaded printDetails methods with different parameters (geeksforgeeks.org).
Method Overriding: The Circle and Rectangle classes override the getArea and printDetails methods from the Shape class, using the @Override annotation (geeksforgeeks.org).
